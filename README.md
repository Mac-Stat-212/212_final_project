## Anchoring Bias in the Stock Market
Welcome to the repo for our final project! Here you can find all the files you need to view our results.

### Data
The first thing you'll have to do is download the data from this google drive link [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cH3DudVXEjdaGil8sPTi4FR9jEkHaBPu/view?ts=67630bdc](URL). It should be saved to the "data" folder within this repository under the name "finished_Data.csv". The relative path should look like this "/data/finished_data.csv".

Then, you can run our cleaning script "../code/Cleaning.R". This is the google drive link:  


### Results
Our finished digital artifact is FinalBlog.qmd. The relative path to find it is "../results/FinalBlog.qmd".  This quarto contains two embedded shinys, which can make the rendering slow, but it shouldn't take longer than a couple minutes. Thanks for checking it out!
