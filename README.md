## Anchoring Bias in the Stock Market
Welcome to the repo for our final project! Here you can find all the files you need to view our results.

### Data
Because our dataset is so large, we created a standalone cleaning file to create a curated dataset.
The original is All_Tickers_5_Year_Data.csv, and the cleaned version is finished_data.csv.

### Results
Our finished digital artifact is FinalBlog.qmd. This quarto contains two embedded shinys, which can make the rendering slow, but it shouldn't take longer than a couple minutes. Thanks for checking it out!
