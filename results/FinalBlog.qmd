## Driving Question

We came to this project with one simple question: Are there biases that impact the daily highs and lows in which stocks are traded? In theory, stock prices should be random, as firms' valuations depend on a multitude of factors that are impossible to predict.

However, humans execute transactions and we wondered if there is a tendency for daily high and low prices to cluster around rounded numbers. At first, we thought the best approach would be to investigate the nominal value of a stock. But quickly, we realized stocks' tendency to trade in values less than 5 dollars was simply because there are more small companies listed in the stock market than larger ones. Then, we came up with the idea of investigating if the last two decimal places of a stock, essentially, its ending cent value, clustered around rounded numbers.

We extracted data from yahoo finance from 2019 to 2024 and plotted graphs to depict what were the most common ending cent values in which daily lows (Figure 1) and daily highs (Figure 2) encountered.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Define the metric you want to visualize
chosen_metric <- "High"  # Replace with the metric of your choice

# Create the label dynamically based on the metric
label <- str_c(chosen_metric, "_cat")

# Generate the bar plot
high <- finished_data %>%
  group_by(!!sym(label)) %>%
  count() %>%
  mutate(cent_price = as.numeric(!!sym(label)) / 100) %>%  # Convert to cent price
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = cent_price, y = n), stat = "identity", fill="darkgreen") +
  labs(
    title = paste("Daily highs, last two digits (cent price): 2019-2024"),
    x = "Cent price",
    y = "Number of Highs"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +  # Ensure y-axis values are regular counts
  theme_minimal()


# Display the plot
print(high)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Define the metric you want to visualize
chosen_metric <- "Low"  # Replace with the metric of your choice

# Create the label dynamically based on the metric
label <- str_c(chosen_metric, "_cat")

# Generate the bar plot
low <- finished_data %>%
  group_by(!!sym(label)) %>%
  count() %>%
  mutate(cent_price = as.numeric(!!sym(label)) / 100) %>%  # Convert to cent price
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = cent_price, y = n), stat = "identity", fill="darkred") +
  labs(
    title = paste("Daily Lows, last two digits (cent price): 2019-2024"),
    x = "Cent price",
    y = "Number of Lows"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +  # Ensure y-axis values are regular counts
  theme_minimal()


# Display the plot
print(low)
```

## Analysis

These graphs present compelling evidence of anchoring bias. There are high peaks at 0 and 50 cents, as well as other round numbers such as multiples of 10 and 25.

If we look closer, another insight we get from these graphs is highs and lows both peak at rounded cent values, but they behave slightly different on how they approach to that peak. When approaching a daily high, traders keep buying until it reaches the 0 value, with lots of trades ending at 99 cents. Instead, when approaching a daily low, traders will buy at .01 and stop buying at .99. This behavior further reinforces the trend, as these barriers act as as support and tension price points.

However, one of the concerns we had was that low volume stocks were driving this behavior. For example, some stocks can be as pricey as \$200,000, and those stocks are usually traded at rounded numbers and by very few individuals. Thus, we created two interactive shiny apps to allow users to view the trends of their choice.

First, we divided all stocks into five categories according to their median volume of daily trades. The user can explore the company size, metric and date of their choice.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
finished_data$Date <- as.Date(finished_data$Date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")  # Ensure the format is "yyyy-mm-dd"

finished_data$Date <- as.Date(finished_data$Date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")  # Ensure the format is "yyyy-mm-dd"

finished_data$volume_range <- factor(finished_data$volume_range, 
                      levels = c("0-10 thousand", "10 thousand-100 thousand", "100 thousand-1 million", "1 million-10 million", "Above 10 million"))

# Grab the input vectors we need
metrics <- c("Open", "High", "Low", "Close", "Adj.Close")
volume_range <- c("0-10 thousand", "10 thousand-100 thousand", "100 thousand-1 million", "1 million-10 million", "Above 10 million")

# Filter to get the stock symbols we need
sp500_symbols <- tq_index("SP500")$symbol %>%
  intersect(finished_data$stock_name) %>% 
  sort()

# Extract trading days from the dataset
trading_days <- finished_data %>%
  pull(Date) %>% # Assuming the 'Date' column is already renamed and in Date class
  unique() %>%
  sort()
```

```{r shiny, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Define UI
ui <- fluidPage(
 
  # Application title
  titlePanel("Aggregate by Trade Volume"),
 
  # Dropdowns to enable user input
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      selectInput("volume_range",
                  "Volume Range:",
                  choices = unique(finished_data$volume_range),
                  selected = unique(finished_data$volume_range)[1]),
      selectInput("metrics",
                  "Metric:",
                  choices = metrics),
      dateRangeInput("date_range",
                     "Date Range:",
                     start = min(finished_data$Date),
                     end = max(finished_data$Date),
                     format = "yyyy-mm-dd",
                     min = min(finished_data$Date),
                     max = max(finished_data$Date),
                     separator = " to ")
    ),
   
    # Show a plot of the generated distribution
    mainPanel(
      plotlyOutput("barPlot")
    )
  )
)

# Define server logic required to draw line graph
server <- function(input, output) {
 
  output$barPlot <- renderPlotly({
    label <- str_c(input$metrics, "_cat") # Dynamic column reference
   
    # Filter data based on stock name and date range
    p <- finished_data %>%
      filter(volume_range == input$volume_range,
             Date >= input$date_range[1] & Date <= input$date_range[2]) %>% # Filter by date range
      group_by(!!sym(label)) %>%
      count() %>%
      mutate({{label}} := as.numeric(!!sym(label))/100) %>% # This weird syntax is necessary because R treats the dynamic label as a string, rather than a column name
      ggplot() +
      geom_bar(aes(x = !!sym(label), y = n), stat = "identity") +
      labs(title = "", x = "Cent Price", y = str_c("Recorded ", input$metrics, "s")) + # Dynamic axis labeling
      theme_minimal()
   
    ggplotly(p)
  })
}

# Run the application
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

Whatever volume you look at, the trend generally maintains. People like rounded numbers and particularly .00 and .50.

The second shiny is for individual stocks. To keep the dropdown manageable, we limited the options to stocks from the S&P 500, minus the seven companies that did not appear in our dataset.

```{r shiny2, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Define UI
ui <- fluidPage(
 
  # Application title
  titlePanel("Individual Stocks"),
 
  # Dropdowns to enable user input
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      selectInput("stock_names",
                  "Stock:",
                  choices = sp500_symbols),
      selectInput("metrics",
                  "Metric:",
                  choices = metrics),
      dateRangeInput("date_range",
                     "Date Range:",
                     start = min(finished_data$Date),
                     end = max(finished_data$Date),
                     format = "yyyy-mm-dd",
                     min = min(finished_data$Date),
                     max = max(finished_data$Date),
                     separator = " to ")
    ),
   
    # Show a plot of the generated distribution
    mainPanel(
      plotlyOutput("barPlot")
    )
  )
)

# Define server logic required to draw line graph
server <- function(input, output) {
 
  output$barPlot <- renderPlotly({
    label <- str_c(input$metrics, "_cat") # Dynamic column reference
   
    # Filter data based on stock name and date range
    p <- finished_data %>%
      filter(stock_name == input$stock_names,
             Date >= input$date_range[1] & Date <= input$date_range[2]) %>% # Filter by date range
      group_by(!!sym(label)) %>%
      count() %>%
      mutate({{label}} := as.numeric(!!sym(label))/100) %>% # This weird syntax is necessary because R treats the dynamic label as a string, rather than a column name
      ggplot() +
      geom_bar(aes(x = !!sym(label), y = n), stat = "identity") +
      labs(title = "", x = "Cent Price", y = str_c("Recorded ", input$metrics, "s")) + # Dynamic axis labeling
      theme_minimal()
   
    ggplotly(p)
  })
}

# Run the application
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

Thanks for checking out our project! We hope you found it as interesting as we did.
